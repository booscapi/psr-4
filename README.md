This is a [custom implementation](https://pretzelhands.com/posts/build-your-own-psr-4-autoloader) 
of a PSR-4 autoloader that can autoload any namespaces specified in 
`conductor.json`. The format follows the same conventions as Composer does.

## 📦 Requirements

* PHP 5.3+ (but please use something more recent)

## 👨‍💻 Getting started

Run `php app.php` in your console. You should see a pretzel
emoji printed out. That's all the application does.

To see the actual implementation of the autoloader, look
at `autoloader.php`. Try playing around with different
namespaces!
